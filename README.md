# Echos
This is a game for [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/)'s [Juice](https://juice.hackclub.com/) program, an exciting opportunity to build a game and then fly to Shanghai to show it off running a game cafe!

To test out the game, head over to the [itch.io page](https://enterprisegoose.itch.io/echos)!

This repo contains two parts:

The game directory contains all of the code a scenes for the game. This can be run using GoDot. Note that assets are not included.

The site directory contains a website for the game, written in solidJS. This can be initialized using pnpm install and then ran using pnpm dev.
